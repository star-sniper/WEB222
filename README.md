WEB222-Web Programming Principles(Summer 2017)

Basic web programming! Please read these couple of notes which might help you succeed:

1) Labs are almost same as what you do in class, so pay extra attention.
2) If you're new to web programming, please learn JavaScript as best as you can.
3) Xml and Json are important but you will score A/A+ if you master HTML and JavaScript integration!!


I struggled in this subject but still score A :P
